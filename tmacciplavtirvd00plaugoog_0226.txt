CRITICAL APPENDIX.

Auuustuuu 1. De mari is hardly likely to be an interpolation. Seyllert
suggests de alto. Schoell trahit for extraxit. Bothe, followed by Fleckeisen,
uallatum extruxit mari. The harsh scansion lxtraxs't might be better got rid ol
by reading uidlum extraxit dl mari: ior the form attilus, see on 936.

Pnouocuu ι. Eius ego sum Luchs, to avoid the accentuation ciris.

13-20. That the whole ol this passage is an interpolation, as several cultim hold,
Iam inclined to doubt: ιι would hardly be intelliglble without 15 (Schoell goes =

so sar as to bracket 1s-²⁷)· But it is highly probable that some part ol the
passage is not Plautiae: sor (i) 17-20 look very much lilre parallel verses to
1346 and oi the nature of dittography (Seyffert): (ii) A probably contained
lewer verses than BCD. The first two pages ol A which contained this passage
have disappeared3 page 3begins with line ao. Now the regular number os verses
on a page oi A is nlneteen3 allowing one page lor the Didascalia and one line on
the second page for the inscription os the Prologue, there could not have been
room sor more than eighteen verses before verse 20 (Studemund, Apographon, note
ou last page ol the Pseudolus). Supposing A not to have had sorne ol the verses

contained in BCD, there would have been room ior an additional verse alter ra
(seeCommentary). .

ts. The conjecture fidicina adopted by Fleck. from carpentarius and Camerarius
is unnecessary; see Luchs in Studemund's Studien, 1.p. 14, Havet in Rev. de Phil.
VIII. p. 109. The sorm fidicinas should therefore be corrected ln Lewis and
Shorb

se. Regarded by Fleckeisen and others as an interpolation. based on 541.
dl. Et adeo (an easy conjecture) is not Plautine, though icrund iu Terence.

7⁷. Fleck. writes qui ibi {or ubi. It would be easy to suggest exul ubi habitat,
senis (for the order ol words ci. 33¹) ; but the text may be souud.
