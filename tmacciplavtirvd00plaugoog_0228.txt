205, 206. From the scanty fragments iegible in A it isclear that 205, 206
formed four verses, and were followed by two more verses which have been lost.
The reading of Min ²05 murt therefore have been mutilated in some way.

211. Reiz (followed hy Fieclr.) inserted ega after Saltem, thus making the line
a cretic tetrameter (reading milti with M): Schoell Aliquem saltlm.

215. Omnia is unintelligible; it cannot he justified hy theorema of 198.

220-228 are treated as trochaic tetrameters (acatalectic) by Fleck. Foliowing
this metre 1 once thought of reading in 223 perpetrasti forperreptaua' : D¹ has per·
pZPtaus', Β* perplaceat. For perpetrant quaerere, ‘I have gone on secking,’ ef.
Truc 465 erficere perpetro(=ecficere pergo). This would make the construction of
the infinitive easier and also that of the abl. (latebris ·quaerere). Fleck. reads
omnis latebras, dependent on perreptare-But 225 is verydifficult to scau as a
trochaic tetrameter, and I have followed Spengel (Reformvorschliige, pp. 253-292
on ‘fehlerhafte trochaisehe Octonare’) iu regarding the whole passage as ana·
paestic. No doubt Plaut in other places shows that he could write better anapaests
than these ς but it is not surprizing ii he sometimes found himself unable to cope
succesdully with the difficulties caused hythe material in which he was working—
the Latin language with its preponderance of long endings.

225. Α has NEQ. (three times), the usual way of writiug neque iu this MS.
BCD¹ have apparently also adopted thia old style in this place, writing Nequed.

227. Schoell gives as the reading of A at the end of the line AlQJi’AECSO·
LAEREGIONES 7 Stud. ATQKAEREGIONES. In my critical apparatusi
have followed Stud. throughout

229-285. Seyffert’s conjecture as to the order of lines (Phil. Wochensch. 2887,
p. 395) is now partly confirmed by A. In 232 Seyffert proposed [Sdncta Spes, me]
lximes lxkac miserdm metui Spengel [Idmne Spes, me] lximes, &c Either of
these suggestions would have the advantage of restoring the exact number of lines
ofA ς but the metres seem to correspond better in my arrangement, in which
Palaestra, who takes the initiative throughout, also starts the new metre in ²29⁸
and 233, Ampelisca following suit. [For Sancta Spes of Cist. IV. 1.18Spes mihi
sancta athenia]

254. Videor (so F) decorum dis Iocum caasser Dousa, Reiz, Fleck.; cf. Curc
260 Hac nocte ua’sus mm ταινίαν, &c

257. aliquo ut Fleck.; hut cf. Brix in Jahrb. 2877, p. 332, and Pseud. 697,
Rud. .
. ildizi'he reading of the MSS. dglrl udltilsta' huc is hardly admissible: it
involves two resolved arses and a catalectic ending (cf. however Epid. 277, Goetz).
225. Lambinus says of cotidie (which is omitted in M, and had been proposed
asan emendation hy Camerarius) ‘sic habent diserte iibri nostri ueteres,’ and in

many other places he quotes from these MSS, eg. Rud. 325, 329, 427 (where he
says ‘ sic legitur hic locus in nostris ueteribus libris sine nlla litura sot depraua-

tione litterarum ') The older commentatore. suchasAcidalias, Dousa and Gruter .

jeered at the ‘codices Lambini' and even at his good faith. Ritschl (Opusc. 11.
118 f.) believes that Lambinus had access toa good MS. (since lost), equal in
valae to B.
