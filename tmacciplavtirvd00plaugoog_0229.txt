nus.1.engen (Beitr. p. 256) proposes commodam for commodo: cf. Tria. 4oo,
where M have commode, but commodam has been rightly restored from A. ·

tlt-815. The passage probably ran as follows iu the archetype of M ε- ⁸
Vt piscatorem aequomst fame sitique speque-o Ι υυυυυυυυ
Ecquem adulescentem huc dum hic astatis

Strenue facie rubicundum fortem qui trista-o
Duceret clamidatos cum macheriis uidisti - neni ---------

the verses being divided at the wrong places. Some accident (perhaps the cutting
or tearing of the parchment in a perpendicular line) made the right hand side of the
paga illegible3 hence the reading of M. Fleckeisen's restoration is violent and
arbitrary: Schoeli’s approximates more nearly to M.

821. thschl (Opnsc. 11. pp. boo-693) preferred r'str'modi; cf. Truc. 930, where
the good MSS. have hominem isti modi. Such genitives as illr', ullr‘, nulli, totr',
uni, soli, atri are common in Old Latin (Luchs in Studemund's Studien, 1. a,
p. 37, derives nostre* from an old nostrius).

858. Schoell considers that Ioh (B) points to [ος but the first letter may bave
arisen from the name of the speaker (T) having been written indistinctly in the

archetype.

869. Fleckeisen reads Ne (asseverative particle, 'veriiy ’), for Nec; so too Goetz
in Asin. 704.
Ἰ 876. Lamb. proposed facturum loc3 Fleck. facere istuc (for the pres. inf-fut.
inf, cf. ou line 307) ς Milli. Jhcere nunc; Reiz (very badly) egl facere lroc; Brix
imistere lroc (cf. Mil. 9²9)-

878. Cauistr'n (=cauistisnei Fleck, unuecessariiy.

884. Camerarius read opsemet, and so the word is corrected in B. But esen if
the clause isa deliberative dependent question, the subj. would, I sm inclined to
think, not be absolutely necessary ; cf. on deliberative pres. indic. 687. ,

886. The spondee in the 4th foot is unusual in this metre (at the end of the
first half of ir) ς hence Brix proposes Sed deice me od illam. AM. I som. ubist.

898. Brix em for iam.
899. sic se Guyet, followed by all editors. But ric seems to have no meaning.

487 bracketed by Fleckeisen aud Schoeii as dittography. But, as Ussing says,
it may be sound. Similar repetitions of ideas already expressed are very common

in Plautus, cf. Langen, Plaut. Stud. p. 72.

457. Confugiam hinc is adopted by Fleckeisen from Z: but hinc would require
aufugiam, as Ussing says. subito milri Camerarius (in which case res=consilriom),
subitaria Ussing, subito mala Schoeii.

408. commodule ludis Fleck, Commodule melli's Schoeil (cf. Truc. 704 ammae.
mellinaest otili Biicheler, Hor. Sat. ΙΙ. 6. 32 hoc iuuat et melli est), Commodule
μέλλεις Onions, ‘you are keepiug me here a pretty time!

490. Voluisti r'n nauem mecum hercle is an old correction, mentioned by Peneus
and adopted by Bo. and F ieck. ‘locatur adhuc leno in miseria sua, dicens se
mendicum factum amisisseque omnes fortunas suas naufragio praeter libertatem,
