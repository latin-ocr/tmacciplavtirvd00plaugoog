341. non uenit? ‘he has not come i '=‘ do you say that he has not
comei' referring to the words of Amp. in 3403 cf. 347, 9379, and
Most. 950, 595 TR. non debet. DA. non debet? Asin. 480, Poen.

699, Η99. 349. In such cases, where the words ola previous speaker
are repeated in the form of a surprised question, Plaut. always uses
nen (not nenne). In other cases he uses nen before consonante,
nonne before vowels (except in Amph. 405 nonne nee M), without
difference of meaning3 cf. Amph. 493-497 where the two words are
used side by side.—Questions without any interrogative particle occur
about 900 times in Plaut. and Terence, and of these instances about
999 contain a negative word (about‘180 non); see Mortis inAmerican
Journ. of Phil. vol. XI. Examples in the Rudens are (i) with nen
947, 995, 42⁶. 723. 749, 870. 942. 9⁶9. 1125. 99799 (ii) without non.
968, 378, 379, 676, 799, 9999, 99678. uera praedicas, ‘ you speak
the truth' ; the preceding question of Trach. being treated by Amp.
as a statement-a piece of funning of which Plant. has availed himself
in several other places3 e. g. Pseud. 9953 f. ’ BA. Te ad ene mese't
Polymachaeroplagides? HARP. Vero numeras, Cist. II. 1. 39 AL. Non
remissuro’s mete· e'llam? ME. Pro me responsas tibi pso A), ‘you
answer yourself,' Cas. V. 4. 13 CL. Ii'enes ceaster. VS. Egone?
CL. Mentire hercle (so A; leand mentire hercle M); sometimes the
answer takes the form ‘you’ve guessed it i’ 9. g. below 347, Asin. 579
LIB. Argenti aegentiminces habes nunc? LE ON. Hore'olare, lit. ‘You
divine well,' Cist. IV. 9. 80 HA. Ificene tu ergo hebetas? PH. Harib-
lare. non est meum, ‘it is not my habit '5 cf. Trin. 993, 639, Asin.

342. quam mox always takes the present (not future) tense in
Plautus ; e. g. Rud. 9997, 9499, Stich. 533 quaen mox coctast ceno?
Truc. 208 quom mox te hnc recipis? Men. 154 qnam mox incerto
rogum? (deliberative, as also Mil. 1406); in dependent questions the
present subj. (not future participle with sein), e. g. Men. 794 preue'sam
1 quam mox uir meus redeat 9999999, Mil. 304 ; coetum is to be taken as
an adjective, or coctumst as a pres. perf.=pres

343. nempe, ‘I presume’; cf. on 968. The true rule for the ,

scansion of nempe in Plaut. was first stated by Seyffert (Berl. Phil.
Wochenschr. 1888, p. 7οο); the first syllable is long before avowel
or fi, short before a consonant ; thus ne'mpi 968, 9957, nipt 565, 567,
1080, 9399 ; whether the first syllable stands in arsis or in thesis
makes no difference3 the word never occupies a complete foot.
remfidtutnam3 a sacrifice to a god meant a dinner for the
sacn cers.

344. certe, ‘surely' 1 cannot agree. with Langen that certe here
means ‘at any rate' (restrictive); see his Beitrfige, p. 95. ‘Surely'
or ‘I arn sure that' suits the context in Mil. 433 certe eque'dem nester
