the analogy 0 em when it stands alone (200 below under cm), makes
this doubtful ; for cm never takes an accus. of the person. '

Eccum, eccam uc.

Eccum, eccam, 22202, eccas, eccillum, eccillam, eccillad, eccistam are
compounds 01 ecce=‘ here is' with a pronoun of the 3221 pers. Here
eccam 820, like ecce with an accus, forms a complete sentence.
Plaut. has ecce about 30111002, its compounds (which do not appear
in class. Lat) about 125 times (thier in Archiv, V. 1, p. 2ο); 0. .
em tibi pateram: eccam Amph. 778 (zeccc eam ‘here it is,' ‘le 101011,
eccum Mil. 25 (01. mod. Italian 2220), domi eccam Pers. 226 ‘itis there
at home‚' eccillum domi ibid. 247, Aul. 781, 01. ellum=em cilum
Bacch. 938, ellam Ad. 389. Sometimes an adj. or noun is added.
agreeing with the last part of the compound: egaram in tabellis
porrectam Pseud. 34, saluam eccam Cist. lV. 2. 77 ‘here it is safe,' 2221
eccum parasitum Pers. 88, 01. Stich. 270, Mil. 470, 545,1216,(127)1.
169, 1015 (thiar eccam fratrem germanam tuom), Cas. 111. 3. 21.
Τ1212 construction is explained by Brix (012 Capt. 1005) by ellipsis of
221, 22 though eccam parasitum stood for eccam (3110,ν 200 infra) para· “
221222221ς but this would not give the require meaning ‘ Herc is the
parasite' (adesi parasitum: eccum parasitum is simply 2222 eum, para·
scium (apposition). These compounds are, lilre the simple 2222,
frequently inserted parenthetically in a complete sentence, and 220
112012 almost equivalent to ‘lo'; e. g. Mmsilachus eccum maestus pra· ⁴
graditur sarm Bacch. 612, cf. Rud. 309 (i), 576, 663, 805, 844, 1209,
2356, Most. 83, 622, 22202 iris nummos habes Men. 219. Occasion-
ally eccam with an accus. in apposition is followed bya finite verb3
e. g. sed eccam Pamphilippum 62222121 Stich. 527, 01 Cure. 678, Mil
2290, Amph. 1005; in the latter instance Goeta punctuates red eccum
Amphitruonem: adamabat this is probably not the way in which it
was seli by Plautus (see Brix on Capt. 1005): it is rather an iat
κοινοῦ construction: 01. Engl. ‘There is a devil haunts thee'=(i)
There is a devil, (11) Α devil haunts thee (see Paul, Principien⁹‚ p. 225).
Occasionally the compound is almost equivalent to a simple pro·
noun (object); e. g. ccca arlico Rud. 2254 ‘1 see them before me,'
309 (1), eccistam arlico Curc. 615 ‘I see her by your side,' ¹eccillam
ariieo Men. 357. In a few passages the MSS. have a feminine
nominative: maier tua ecca iic ratur Daedalis Rud. 1174, eapse ecca
cxii Men. 180, scd ecca epm egreditur Eun. 79, Stich. 536 (eccilla M,
eccillam A). This usage might possibly be explained as a develop-
ment of the construction last mentioned, but it is probably safer to
read the accus. with recent editors. In the passage 01 1120 Rud.
(1274) the finite verb 22112 understood (unless we read rictas! with

angen); so too in Capt. 1005 scd erar eccum anic astam, 2122222 alter

eccum cx Ata rediit (MSS).
