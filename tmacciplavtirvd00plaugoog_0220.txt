ΟΝ ΒΟΜΕι EXCLAMATORY PARTICLES IN THE Rvnnlts.

Ecce ¹.

Ecce is used in two ways in Plautus.

(i)=‘ here is' with an accusative as object, generally a pronoun ol ’

the rst pers.; here ecce with its object forms a complete sentence, eg.
ecce me: French me oot'ct', Rud. 241, Epid. 680, Pers. 726, Merc.
131, Mil. 663, Ad. 995, ecce nos Mil. 611, ecce honorium tc notati Trin.
1013, ecce Grzbi scelera Rud. 1178, cccc odzitm meum Poen. 352. (Ecce
may be an old imperative from the root AK‚ as Curtius and Vanidek
say,.=‘ see': cl. ocu-luo). This construction was not used hythe
writers ol the classical period, who preferred the nom. (a construction
difficolt to explain grammatically, as no verb is ever used, and est, is
supplied, would not give the sull sense), eg. Cic. de Prov. Cous. 43
ecce illa tempestas, Brut. ¹²5. sed ecce in monz'bus ur'r, Juv. IV. 1 ecce
iterum Crzipinus. Vergil has the accus. once (Εοί. V. 66), but
elsewhere the nom. (e. g. Aen. ΙΙΙ. 477, VI. 46, Vll. 766). Alter the
3rd century nn. the acc. again becomes common—a return to the
popular idiom, which had been ignored but not suppressed during
the classical period. Similarly in modern Greek we lind νά με in
psopular sp)eech, illut ἐγώ in literary speech (see thler in Archiv,

. 1, p. 25 . .

(ii)=‘lo,' in a sentence which is grammatically complete without
the interjection; e. g. ecce, Apollo, denuo me abbessacere mpetum in eum
Men. 868, cl. 841, Mero. 100, Mil. 203 ecce avortit, 456, Most 660,
676 ecce autem periz': in Terence always with autem, e. g. Eun. 967,
Phorm. 264, Ad. 153: lor sed ecce cl. Most. 496. This construction
is common in the classical period, eg. Cic. de Or. ll. 94 ecce oti est
exortus Isocrates, de Repub. Ι. 35, Verg. Ecl. IX. 47, Aen. 11. 403,

Insbne passage of Plaut. ecce stands alone, Asin. 109 DEM. Atque
