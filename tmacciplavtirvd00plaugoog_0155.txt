‘bath’ cl. machina μαχανά (Doric) ; putica, πατάνης ductito, desdam
tranire, τρυτάνη, &c lt was the business ol the baltheum (βαλανιύς,
‘bath man ’) to pour cold water over the heads of the bathers alter they
had taken a warm bath ; his assistants were called παραχύται. Neptune
does the work so thoroughly that the bather leels cold even when

528 ff. It is possible to scan aba 38 ab: but perhaps it is more
natural in view os lines 539, 533, 534, 537, 538 to suppose that the word
algeo or abit is spoken with chattering teeth‚ etl-algeo or reb-abit, cl.
Most. 339, 333 nra-ma-madere, ‘to be ti-ti-tipsy,' the stammer ola »
drunlren man. It is a remarkable fact that in this passage (528-538)
there are no less than six lines in which the questiones hiatus arises3
and they are all spoken bypersons who are sktbm‘ng wath cold. Seyffert .
on 537 l. suggested that we might read Iure optumo-mo νηί-3333133833
arbitror, and Ovi? Oudoura, thus preserving the order of words in
the MSS. and getting rid ol the hiatus ; and the same metbod should
be applied to the other five lines. Thus read with ‘corusca uerba'

638. arnotinus, adj. from anas, ‘duck,' gen. anani or anthi (Capt.
1003 anaks, Cic. de Nat. Deor. 11. 334 antium), cf. Asin. 693 anrlr'cula
B· D, aneticrda B' (diminutive ol anas). Correct the spelling of both
words in Lew. and Sh. . y ἢ

utor regularly takes the abl. in Plaut, Tea, Cato and the
tragedians, as in class. Lat.; the accus. oi a neuter pronoun is found
(Mers. 145, Asin. 199‚Ad. 815),and in two passages the accus. of
a noun or participle (Poen. 1088 operam meam, Rud. 3343 partum:
Stich. 459 a, Epid. 364 are probably interpolated). Yet that the word
originally (before Plautus) took an accus. is made probable by the
common gerundive constr. (e. g. Rud. 602 scalas utendas) and the lact
that abutor always takes the accus. in Plaut. and Ter. (Trin. 683,
Bacch. 359 l, Phorm. 433, tac). See Langen in Archiv III. 3.
