overgrown with bullrushes and other plants: cl. line 523 where
Labrax congratulates the bullrush (0 scirpe, see'rpe, leudosortunar tuas,
om· semper seruas gloriam areiudine's), and 630 where silphium and
asafoetida (sirpe et lasserpe'ceiem) are mentioned as cultivated on the
land of Daemones. Before the temple stands an altar: cl. on Act III.
Sc. 3¹. The sea is supposed to be visible to the actors: ef. lines
148-155. The side doors leading on to the stage to right and left
served for the entrance and exit of persons not coming from or going
into the temple or cottage. According to the ordinary usage of the
Roman stage, the door to the left of the spectators served for the
entrance oi persons from foreign parts (peregre), that to the right of
the spectators for the entrance of inhabitants of the place ¹. This
standing custom helped to malie the action of the piece intelligible to
the spectators, serving to some extent the purpose of the ‘programme,'
in the modern theatre. In most of the comedies of Plautus and
Terence, the scene is laid in a city; hence the entrance to the left was
identified with the approach to or from the harbour (portus), where
those coming from foreign parts landed ; and the entrance to the
right with the approach to or from the town (sorum) or country. In
the Rudens, however, the scene is laid in the country, and it seems
probable that the door to the left of the spectators was used by those

coming frorn Cyrene or its harbour (i. e. peregre in relation to the
inhabitants of the coast), and that to the right by those coming from
the sea shore ³.

'ibe town and harbour are ihioughout the play treated as almost
convertible terms (cl. on 111. 6, and lines 856, 1200), and the sea shore
was in the immediate neighbourhood of the cottage and temple.

¹ Langon, Plautinische Studien, pp. 212 f., supposes the altar to stand before the
cottnge3 bnt his argument from lie 688 involves the supposition thet Trachalio had
not moved from his position before the cottage in111.2; for the explanation of
linea 706r. (leuc) see commentary. Probably the temple and cottage were not far
from each other.

² This le proved by Amphitruo 333: Sosia arrives from the harbour3 Mercury,
⁸eetlee e'sface'ng tle spectators, says Hinc enim neili dexteri uox auris, ut uidetur,
eurberat3 i. e. Sosia wes on his right and on the lest of the spectators: cf. too
Meo. 555 f.

⁸ The arrangement in the Rudens would thus be similar to that prevailing in the
theatre of Dionysus at Athens. Any other theory than that mentioned ebore gives
riae to difficulties, and obliterates the signifrcanee of the two side doors
