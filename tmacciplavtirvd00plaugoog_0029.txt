that it contains a good many names ol speakers in the text; these are
toa large extent omitted in C, and altogether omitted in B. D has
been corrected either by another hand or by the original scribe him-
sell at a subsequent time (D²); it also contains corrections by a
scholar ol the 14tb or r5th century (D) ¹. ,

The three MSS. B CD are very similar and are obviously derived
lrom a common archetype. They are often spoken oi together as the
‘Palatine MSS.' ; and the readings common to them are indicated in
the critical apparatus by the symbol M ¹.

5. The ‘Codex Lipsiensis’ (F), a MS. ol the 15th century ol
no authority (see Ritschl‚ Prolegomena to Trinummus).

In the text Ι have abandoned the traditione! Drvrsrort ntro Acrs, an
arrangement due to the editors of the time of the Renaissance: the
Plautine division is simply into a number oi Scencs. The division into

live Acts serves no uselul purpose, and there is an additional reason
ior giving it up in this play, as those responsible lor it have obviously
blundered at the 5th Act: so too in the Captivi. At the same time
the traditional numeration by Acts and Scenes is retained at the heads
ol peges in the text lor the sake ol convenience of reference.

the name at changes ol speakers in the text.
(ii) The rdles ol the charactere, painted in ‘minium' under the
names.

The Ambrosian MS. oi Plautus had originally the same arrange·

second is blank, the minium having entirely disappeared in the pro-

sake oi brevity‚ but also to indicate clearly the reading os tlte archetype to which
the readings ol B, C, and l) point, insignificant differences being neglected. Where
the differeuees between the three MSS. areos importance their readings are cited
separately.
