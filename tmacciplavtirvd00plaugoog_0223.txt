perative from the root ΛΚ, and n a demonstrative suffix (ct'. 61111191ιὶ11,
sin, dac.); it this is true and ern=en¹, then ecce, ent, en are all
etymologically related But en is more generally supposed to be tbe'
Greek tr. Other derivatione which bave been suggested ior eno are (1)
:earn accus. ol ir (Ribbeck), (ri) τιδι’, the final ι’ being dropped and
d liquilied to rr3 cf. tbe parallel lorms sirmam, mnndi (Richter).

Hem differs in two respects from em: (t) it is always an interiection,
not aflecting the construction of the sentence; (ii) it expresses motion

llam has nothing to do with Engl. ‘ahem,’ the sound of clearing
the throat, as is sometimes said. The statements about all these
exclamatory words in the grammars are quite misleading, at any rate
in regard to their use by Plautus.

linem is like hem in so sar as it does not affect the construction of
the sentence and expresses emotion; it differs from leem in that it
expresses a pleasant sense of surprise. ‘Est laeta exclamatio eius
quirem non expectatam deprehendit, aut rem ex inopinato super·
uenientem cum quadam admiratione excipit. . . . Neque aliter ii quibus
cogitantibus redit res; arripiunt eam cum laeta exclamatione’ Hand,
Turs. 11. p. 356: e.g. Rud. 805, Asin. 449, Mil. 1381, Pseud. 911,
Ε11. 651, Haut. 611, 758, Ad. 81, 166 ; examples of ehem used by
those ‘quibus cogitantibus redit res' are Mil. 1. 1. 36, Most. 717,

Eu, euge, eugepae.

ltu is called by Brix (on Mil. 394) 1 ‘particula laetantis et laudantis'
and this seems to describe it admirably: eumd, ‘well' ‘well done,'
‘well met,' ‘braym' ‘hurrah': cf. Men. 174 f., Mil. 1146, Most. 339,
Phorm. 398, 478, 869 tec. It is frequently joined with lacte, edepol,
11 ecastor, e. g. eu hercle Pers. 716, eie edepol Men. 160, eu ecastor Mil.

1161 φ, and sometimes these combinatione are followed by an accus.
of excamation, eg. Rud. 415, Poen. 613 eu edepol mortalis malos,
ibid. 1117 eu hercle mortalem catum, Mil. 394 eu hercle praesens
rommiem, ibid. 1166 eu ecastor pertarum. See further under heu.
