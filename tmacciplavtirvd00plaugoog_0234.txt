CRITICAL APPENDIX. 201

1313. Miiller Nummi octingenti 111 111111, 01. 1310. Schoell Nummi octingenti
auri 111111.

1314. Langen (Beitr. p. 87) supplies the lacuna with auri, reading Ρ11111110
centum auri minae Philippi, ⁴ a hundred 101010 01 goldeu Philips (Philippian
gold),’ 01. Μ11. 1061, 1410, Truc 936. Reiz (followed by Fleckeisen) produced 1
regular tetrameter by transposition : Praeterea centum Phdippcae minae, but what
was a mina Philhtpeal The term Philippeia: or Philippus is applied only 10
coam.

In support 01 the reading 01 Seyffert it should be noticed (i) that the reading 01
the MSS. phe'le'ppeh taken with philippus 01 Nonius makesa neuter plural probable;
(ii) the corrupt 11111111 01 Nonius suggests a polysyllable ; (iii) praeterea ought to
introduce the mention 01 1 11111111 sum than in 1315, and also 01 1 special kind 01
coin (preserved separately from the rest).

Schoell reads centum milia Philippi (sc. 11111); but the weight 01 100,000
Philips would have been about 17 cwt. (see under ethaeros in Lidd. and Sc.)-
rather a heavy load 101 a man 10 fisb up and carry. According to 997 the
uailulus was not 1 large one.

1311. Seyffert points out that ergo may easily have origiuated out 01 ERCLE·
EGO. ·

13171. The distribution 01 the speeches causa some difficulty. Ussing gives
the passage as follows'(with the MSS.) :—GR. Somnias. LA. Nihil addo. GR.
Ati egitur. LA. Audi. 611811111111111111111,1111111111. LA. Vin
1111111111 millet and explains that when Gripits says Aba· egitur he makes 1 show
01 going away himself. One cannot, however, bnt feel that Si hercle. &c., ought to be
said byadiiierent person from Abi a'ga'tur. Fleckeisen gives GR. Somna'as. LA.
Nr'ltiluddo: 111. GR. Igituraudi : Si 111111 abiero hinc, 11111111 ero. LA. Vin
1111111111 11 millet But 111 is much less suitable in the mouth 01 Labrax than
in that 01 Gripus ; it is Labrax who takes the initiative in making the successive
offers, and who should be told to be oli when his oiiers are not accepted. The
same objection would apply to reading LA. Nihil addo: 111 egitur. GR. Audi.
Schoell changes Abi into Abeo (GR. Abeo egitur. LA. Audi. GR. Siherclc.
&c.); here again Abeo is not in place. The solution 01 the difficulty seems to be
to regard the words Si 111111 1111111111, 111 1111111001 as a reply to audi (‘ 11 Ι ’
go away, 1 can’t 11111),1101 aa simply calling the attention 01 Gripus 10 the fact
' that 11 Labrax goes away the negotiatione will come 10 an end—a result which

would not be inlaccordance with the wishes 01 Gripus. '

1335. This line is certainly obscure, and the reading 01 the MSS. (id quod) is
unmetrical. Schoell considers that two half lines have been lost between Praei
uerba's quidue& and 111 quod domist, and this is approved by Saye. who supplies
