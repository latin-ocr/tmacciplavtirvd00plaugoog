J INTRODUGTION. xvii

The Mruuscrrn’rs containing the Rudens, or parts 31 11, are :—

1. The Ambroslan (A), a palimpsest 31 the Ambrosian Library
at Milan, which contains beneath a coarsely executed Latin MS. 31
parts 31 the Old Testament (Books ol Kings), a MS. 31 parts 31
Plautus, Seneca and Ulfilas, 31 the 4tb or even the grd century¹. It ’
was discovered by Cardinal Mai, who in 1815 published an imperfect
collation in his M. Accr'r‘ Plauti Fragmenta Inedr‘ta, at the same time
seriously injuring the MS. by the use 31 improper chemicals. Mould ’
and damp have also done their work, 3ηά the original writing is err·
tremely hard to decipher ; in some pages scarcely more than the frame
31 the borders remains'. The palimpsest has been subsequently ,
collated with lar greater care'by Ritschl, Schwarzmann and Geppert,
and in recent years by Loewe and Studemund. The results 31 the
labours 31 the latter, extending over a period 31 twenty-five years, are
now accessible to the world in his Tr'tr' Macci Plauti F obulorum Reli·
qur'ae Ambrosrirnae (Berlin, Weidmann, 1889), edited alter his death
by his friend Seyffert; this work may be regarded as the most authori-
tative 31 existing collatione. Only parts 31 the original codex are
extant-those which the scribe 31 the yth or 8th century with cruel
kindness preserved sor the reception oi his copy 31 the Books 31 -
Kings, delacing as lar as he could one 31 the most valuable and
ancient codices 31 any Latin author. The parts ol the Rudens which
are contained in Α are indicated in the Critical Apparatus.

a. The ‘Codex Vetus (B),’ a MS. 31 the rrth century, now in the
Vatican Library at Rome, and first collated in the 16th century by
tbe great German scholar Joachim Camerarius. It contains 311 the
extant comedies (not the Vidularia) and is the main source lrom which
our existlng texts are derived. The original reading 31 Β has been
in many places corrected by other hands 31 various ages, the most
important being the rto-called ‘manus secunda' (81). ⁴ In recent times
it has been collated alresh by Ritschl, Ramsay, Ussing, Loewe and
Schoell.

3. The ‘Codex Decurtatus' (C), a MS. 31 the rath century, now at
Heidelberg.

4. The ‘Codex Ursinianus' (D), 3 MS. 31 the 11th Century⁸, now

in the Vatican. The value 31 this MS. depends partly on the lact

ι83γ11311 13 Stndemnnd’s Apographon, p. xxll. The date 31 the MS. 31 the
Bnolrs 31 Kings is 31 the ’yth or eth century.
