The Rursus was probably first acted in the year ac. 19² ¹. The
scene is laid on the coast in the neighbourhood of Cyrene.

The plot¹ is based upon the recovery by a fisherman, called Gripus,
oi a vidulus, or wicker bashet used as a paching case, which has been
lost at sea and which contains among other articles the crepundia or
‘tohens’ ol the heroine Palaestra, who has fallen into the hands oia
slave-dealer, Labrax. Labrax is attempting to carry her off by sea to
Sicily; but the ship is wreclred upon the African coast, in the neigh-
bourhood ol Cyrene. Those on board escape dronning, but their
property goes to the bottom. The play derives its name ‘The Rope,'
from an amusing scene (IV. 3) in which Gripus, carrying the vr'dulus
which he has¹ fished up, and trailing behind him a rope which is
attached to it, is accosted by Trachalio—the slave ol Plesidippus ⁸, an
Athenian youth and the lover ol Palaestra. Trachalio, who is acting
in the interest oi the heroine, seizes the other end of the rope and
demands that Gripus shall restore the booty to its rightsul owner.
The crepundia thus return into the possession of Palaestra, and by
means ol them the customary duayvdpwu is effected: Palaestra is dis-
covered to be the long lost daughter of Daemones, an Athenian erile,
hring in poverty on the coast ol Cyrene, and the master ol Gripus.

We are not informed definitely of the nameus the Greek original
on which the Rudens is founded. But a strong case has been made
out⁴ in favour oi the supposition that it was a play ol Diphilus⁸ oi
similar content to that imitated by Plautus in the Vidularia, or ‘Story
