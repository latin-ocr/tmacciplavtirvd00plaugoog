151. In answer to the leading question of Daem. (qur, ‘how soi')
Scep. says, ‘Because they toolr a bath yesterday after dinner.’ This
is explained by Lambinus and Ussing to be a way oi saying ‘Because
they have lost all their possessions by shipwreclr'-their min being
analogous to the buming oi the remnants: propter urbm would then
be adjectival to prandiam, ‘a parting breakfast! But why post ¹
cenam? Ussing's explanation is lame: ‘instead of following the usual
practice of bathing besore dinner‚ these men have bathed after dinner
in preparation for the morrow's breakfast! Why leri? How can
Scep. know that the shipwreclr did not taire place that morning? Does ,
he mean to say that they have been in the water all night (ci. natant
155)? irruerunt, ‘bathed' In Plautus Inuire means ‘to wash,'
lauare (lauari Poen. 220, 229), ‘to bathe,’ i.e. ‘to nash oneseff’:
Seyffert, Stud. Plaut. p. 7. Laui serves as perfect to both verbs;
lautus is the peri. part. of lauare (ci. 301, 701) ; leuatus and lanatum
the peri. part. and supine ο1 lauare (cf. 382); Langen, Beitr. p. 297. A
good collection ο1 instances is given by Lorenz in his Critieal Appendix
to Pseud. 8 (10). See too Nettleship’s Contributions to Lat. Lex. ’

154. hui, almost a whistle, ‘whew l’ Here it serves 'to call atten-
tion to the exclamation which follows; ci. Truc. 29. Haut. 480, Hec.
283: often it expresses surprise, eg. Pers. 805, Eun. 407, Haut. 92,
’ Phorm. 558, 7913 Richter, De usu part. exciam, p. 582. ¹

155. homunculi, ‘poor mannilrins’; cf. Capt. Prol. 51 homunculi
quanli sunt, Trin. 491, ἐφημέριοι ἅνθρωποι. quanti, gen. oi price
(originally locative), here=‘h0w little worth,' as in Capt. Prol. 51.

did not give us the hint (ut ualeamus), we bear it in mind,'· ior

between such examples as this and ¹those treated in my note on 1021.

160. Palaemon, a sea deity worshipped at the Isthmus, among
other places (ci. Apollod. III. 4. 3, Paus. ΙΙ. 2. r) and identified by the
Romans with their Portunus, the protecting deity of harbours: cf. Eur.
