of the Wicker Basket,' (sufetula) ¹. Of the latter play, only frag-
ments are preserved in the Ambrosian palimpsest (Α); but from them
we are enabled to gather that the action takes place on the sea coast,
probably in the neighbourhood of a temple of Venus 1, 01111 11001 the
house of an old man called Dinia, whose rfle corresponds to that
of Daemones in the Rudens. Nicodemus, who like Palaestra is of
good family, has been wrecked at sea and lost a verutus containing
hIs signet ring. As in the Rudens, father and child have been
separated so long that they do not recognize one another at first sight.
The fisherman Gorgo, who has given shelter to Nicodemus, fishes up
the vr'dulur. The slave Cacistus, who has watched what has happened
from the myrtle bushes near the temple, demandsthe booty for blm-
self. But Gorgo, who plays the partos the honourable slave and
desires merely to restore the vriiulur to its owner, -conveys 'it to his hut
and recommends Cacistus to find a patronus (cf Rud. 1380). Just
as Daemones in the Rudens is involuntarily reminded of his lost

daughter when he sees Palaestra, so in the Vidularia the sound of
Nicodemus' voice revives in Dinia the memory of bis son. Dinia is
appointed sequester (cf. Rud. 1004),1110 vrilulus is opened, and by
means of the signet ring the recognition of Nicodemus as the son of
Dinia is brought about. The Greek original of the Vidularia bore the
title Σχιδία, according to the Prologue preserved in· A. Plautus called
his adaptation ‘The Wicker Basket,‘a title which would have been
equally well suited to the Rudens. It would seem that having already
employed this title for the Vidularia (which must therefore have been
an earlier play) 110 was debarred from using it for the Rudens, and
was driven to adopt the less suitable name of ‘The Rope.' Schoell
(Rheinisches Museum, XLIII, p. 098) conjectures that the origInal of
the Rudens was called nipe, ‘the wellet?

ed. Niemeyer, p. 30, agree that the Roman stage was very long. This great

length made it possible to represent in one view the coast as well as the two
buildings mentioned above.
