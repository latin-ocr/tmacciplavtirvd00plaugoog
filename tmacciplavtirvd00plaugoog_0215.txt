age? In sponsiones and stipulationes what the challenges denies is in·
troduced by si, what he affirma by m‘: the conditione are expressed
from the point of view of the person challenged. Here Labrax means

made under false pretences' (dolo mato). ii. ‘I am under 25 years
of age,' an impudent falseh00d; he had grey hairs, cf. 125 siscanum.
Hence, we are bound to read (with Priscian) nite in the second clause,
which moreover contains the word etiamdum, ‘as yet,' which is used ,
only where a negative is expressed or implied. This usage of ni and

that of 1021 (here joined with an imperative in the principal clause, cf. ·
