&awa 4. Enter Daemones, Palaestra, and· Ampelisca from the
cottage. Daemones tells the girls that they must again seek the pro·
tection of the altar, as his wife's jealousy prevents him from keeping
them any longer in his house. Gripus and Trachalio lay their quarrel
before Daemones: Trachalio declares that Gripus is in possession of
the travelling trunlr lost by Labrax and containing Palaestra’s trinlset
case, in which archer ‘tokens ἐ he demands that the case and its con-
tents be restored to their owner, in order that she may have the means

. of discovering her parents and proving herself free born. In spite of
the protests of Gripus, Daemones puts the question to the girls whether
they recognise the trunk3 Palaestra answers in the affirmative, and
offers to describe minutely its contents in order to establish her claim.
The uadatus is opened, and Palaestra, after removing to a distance,
describes the contents of the trinket case. As Daemones takes thern
out one by one, he discovers, to his amazement and joy, that Palaestra
is his long lost daughter. Daemones, Palaestra, Ampelisca, and
Trachalio retire into the cottage to inform the mother of the happy
event ; and Gripus, after a short soliloquy, in which he curses his lucis,
follows them
