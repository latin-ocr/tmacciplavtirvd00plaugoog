it his aim to remove the frequent blunders with which the

text is marrcd in the MSS, but at the same time he must
recognize the limitations under which he works : in passages
where the MSS. present deep seated and lar reaching cor·
ruptions the attempt to restore the original text is sometimes
purely illusory. Here, as elsewhere, it is the part os wisdom
to lace the hard truth. Sunt certi denique fines quos ultra
citraque nequit consistere rectum. 1 cannot hope that I have
mysels always attained to this ideal; but Ι have borne it
steadfastly in mind. Moreover it is surely as great a triumph
ol criticism to demonstrate on sufficient evidence that a
suspected reading ol the MSS. is sound, as to restore a
corrupt passage by emendation. Every year makes it more
evident that slashing criticism produces results which are
shilting as the sands: ‘the true is one, the false are many.'
The first harvest os certain emendations was made long ago.

Yet there still remain a large number ol passages in which Ι

emendation, based upon a more accurate knowledge ol the
MSS. and ol the laws ol Plautine language¹ and prosody than
was accessible to scholars ol the sixteenth and seventeenth
centones, may reach a high degree os probability or even
certainty.

The Critical Apparatus Ι have designedly made short and
. comparatively simple. But I hope that nothing ol im-
portance has escaped me. My apparatus holds a midway
position between that ol Schoell, who records everything‚
even the variant ol a capital sor a small letter, and that os
Ussing, who does not take account ol the Palatine MS. D.

ln the commentary Ι have not hesitated to give lull ex·
planations ol all difficulties which struck me. Itis my hope
that the notes will serve the purpose o'l a general introduction
