I rather incline to the other possibility suggested by Nettleship that rt ⁴

is‘ some bastard rssue 01 11041ρή711 υμι,’ 1 word very common in Greek
comedy. At any rate, as Nettleship shows, there is no analogy in
Latin sor the old derivation from dis and erigo (¹ to raise up asunder'

pig and porkers,' apun on sucula ‘windlass'z the addition ol 11111
porculis is necessary to bring out tile point 01 the joke. Apparently
the word pauculus also meant a hook or ring attached to a windlass,
cf. Cato, R. R. XIX. 2 porculum in medab sucula facz'to ; perhaps this
technical sense 01 pauculus was itself a metaphorical expression sug-
gested by sucula. In Mero. 988 cum porcis cum fiscalia sounds like
a proverbial phrase derived from the sarm.
