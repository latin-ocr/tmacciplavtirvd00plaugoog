absolutely decisive passage for either 1111 ar der, except Cas. rtet. 44 Dee 1111,
which is of course post-Plautiae (in Curc. 161 det is better than 1111), but Iam
inclined to doubt whether dat was ever long in Latin: ddre stands on a (11111111
footing from ordlnary verbs of the 111 conjugation. The dactyl Versa Ι dat may
be admitted in the siret foot of the noch. tetram, cf. 1093, Stich. ¹³⁵ Vtsnel

1180. Fleck, Schoell and Ussing change 111111 to 111111 or aa'bat (referring to

Trachalio) 1 but this seems to be quite unnecessary (see explanatory note): aiebas
is defended by Benoist and Miiller. Plaut. Pros. pp. 61, 477.

1181. DAE. Perge, 11 obsecre, Acidalius, adopted by Fleckeisen; but as Bn'x

Perge, te ebsecro, which 11 not open to this objection. But the reading of the MSS.

quarn lusi, after Bothe), but ylelds uo tolerabis sense.

127 e. Fleckeisen, followed by Schoell, reads Etiamne eam salutem adueniens
but I have been unwilling to alter the order of the words in the MSS.. which
reappears in 1177. Ussing retains Etiamne of the MSS, apparently regardiug the

eam as an elided monosyllable. Ramsay reports that B has Etiam ne ‘i adueniens,
a variant not recorded iu the collations of Schoell aud Ussing.

1290. Fieri audio usquam niduli, quasi palo pectus tundor Reiz, Fleckeisen,
Ussing (pectus being acc. of respect, a usage difficolt to parallel in Plaut.; Most.

the words nen hac as of the nature of a gloss upon aliud.
