EXCVRSVS.

Em, hem, ehem ¹.

Till the time os Bentley em was entirely ignored or misunderstood
by editors: Bentley introduced it in' two places (Ad. V. 3. 4, Phorm.
1. 2. 2), but without note. It was not till our own day that the word
was properly recognized, first by Ritscbl in his Mercator (published in
1854), and afterwards more thoroughly by Brix, Ribbeck, and other
recent editors. ln MSS. it is sometimes written hcm (an altogether
different word), occasionallyen²5 trie frequencywith which cm appears
varies as the excellence oi the MS.; in the Ambrosian of Plautus it is
sound in 26 places, and in B more osten than in CD3 in the
Bembine of Terence in 23 places.

Bm (like cccc) is used in two ways :-

(i) =‘there is,’ ‘voila,’ with an accusative (denoting a thing) or a
dative (always tibi), or both accus. and* dat, as direct and indirect
objects: here em with its object or objects forms a complete sentence,
eg. em tibi aquam, ‘there you have the water’ Rud. 463, Amph. 778,
Asin. 880, Poen. 382, em manum Capt. 859, em scelera Andr. 785, em
tc'bi, hic habet urilulum 1111111357, Mil. 1405, Capt. 631, Men. 1018,
dcc. In the classical period en began to be used sor em, and generally
with the nominative instead ol the accusative, e. g. en Przicmus Verg.
Aen. I. 461, though the accus. is still sometimes sound, e. g. cn quattuor ¹
aras Ecl. V. 65; contrast ecce homo with ecce bornehem.
ihi) =‘ look l' ‘there i' in a sentence which is grammatically complete
wi out the interjection: e. g. cm sic uolo Rud. 463, em citaec ratio

Occasionally em stands alone: e. g. AR. aspice cd mc. TV. cm,
