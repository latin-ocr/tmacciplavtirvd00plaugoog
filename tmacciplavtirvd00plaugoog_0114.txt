NOTES.

Aramum-Ol the twenty plays ol Plautus preserved to us, nine·
teen are provided with acrostic arguments ; five ol these have also
non-acrostic arguments, the Amphitruo, Aulularia, Mercator, Miles
Gloriosus, and Pseudolus, and there are traces ol non-acrostic argu-
ments to the Persa and the Stichus in the Ambrosian palimpsest (A);
one play, the Bacchides, has 110 argument, the beginning oi the piece
having been lost. All these arguments are certainly post-plautina
Ritschl (Prolegomena to Trinummus, p. 316 l.) held them to be oi the ·
time ol the Antonines (and century A.n.)',a time when early Latin·
literature was eagerly studied by the learned, and when the metrical
arguments to the books of the Aeneid and the plays os Terence were
written. This date is generally accepted lor the non-acrostic argu-
ments (see Opitz, De acrostichorum Latinorum arte et origine, 1883).
But the acrostics are held by Seyffert and Teufiel to be not later than
a century after the death oi Plautus‚i e. nc. 84 (cl. Cicero, Brutus 15,
where Plautus is said to have died in the year os Cato's censorship, s. c.
184), this opinion being based on the lact that the acrostics show an
acquaintance with Plautine metre and prosody which itis not likely
that a writer ol the age of the ¹Antonines possessed.

1. Scan exuant: the syllables mdri lxtrdx· form an anapaest, cl.
Introduction to Captiui A (ii), p. 11, where such scansione as senictritr',
uolrintdte, uetrlsldte, in dccdlto, ita rit dict's, tre„ are quoted from Plautus.
The writer ol the acrostics for the most part used such shortenings ol
long syllables only in the first foot. nidulus, awlcker basiet (cl. 990
ur'torem), covered with leather ol various colours (cl. 998) and used to
paclr minor articles in (el. 1130 cartellam, Men. 1036 marsuppium cum
uziatr'co). The first syllable is always long, so from twenty to thirty
times in this play aud in Men. 1036, Epid. aa. [Insert the quantity
in Lewis and short]

2. crepundta3 cf. on 1081. ·

3. od aliquem uentre here=in alr'cur'us potestatem uenam: ‘had
fallen into the hands of a master who was a slave dealer '; cl. Mil. 9 5
ad hunc devenerim in sermiutem (contrast the phrases quoted on 5).
